# HoneyBeeGame
The aim of the project is to investigate and provide insights into pathfinding algorithms for game development.We have explored the relationship between various A*-based algorithms. First there is an overview of pathfinding. Then, there are details of A* algorithm is addressed as a basis of delivering a number of optimization techniques from different angles. Finally, an implementation in the form of game which we named as Honey Bee Game that we have made with C# and Unity. Honey Bee game basically depicts that you have to enter start and ending position of a bee and then it will give you the minimum distance.
